"""Share one copy of a stage's weights between two processes on one GPU.

A PD-disaggregated stage runs its two halves in separate processes. On one
device that means two copies of the same weights: measured at 57 GiB each for
the Qwen3-Omni thinker, which leaves a 140 GiB card with room for about 21,500
KV tokens per half against 677,613 on a colocated card.

The halves already map each other's GPU memory for the KV plane. Weights are
the easier case: static, read-only, allocated once, never reclaimed until
shutdown, so none of the reserve/commit/abort machinery applies. One half
exports handles to its parameter storage, the other points its own parameters
at that storage and releases what it loaded.

Peak memory is unchanged -- the adopting half still constructs and loads before
it swaps -- but the KV pools are sized after that, so they see the freed space.
