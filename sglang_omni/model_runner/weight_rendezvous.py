"""Hand parameter handles from one PD half to the other at startup.

:mod:`sglang_omni.model_runner.weight_sharing` can export and adopt handles,
but the two halves are separate processes with no channel between them at load
time. The KV plane does not supply one: ``prepare_kv_receive`` and
``send_kv_pages`` are per-transfer and run long after both halves are up.

This uses the directory the run already has. ``create_ipc_runtime_dir`` makes
one private directory per pipeline instance before any stage is spawned, every
stage is handed endpoints inside it, and it is removed when the run ends. A
file there is therefore visible to both halves, private to the run, and cleaned
up without new ownership rules.

Publishing is a write to a temporary name followed by ``os.replace``, so a
reader never observes a partial file. Reading returns ``None`` when the peer
has not published rather than waiting for it: ``_construct_scheduler`` builds
each stage inside ``gpu_startup_lock(gpu_id)``, so two halves on one device
load one at a time, and a reader that waited would hold that lock against the
very half it is waiting for. A half that finds nothing publishes its own
handles instead, so whichever loads second is the one that adopts.
